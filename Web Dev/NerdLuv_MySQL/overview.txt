This is an extension of the dating application NerdLuv I wrote in my Web Development course at Millersville University.
I revised the NerdLuv PHP front-end to communicate with a web service via HTTP requests (both GET and POST) and JSON.
I also wrote the NerdLuv web service using PHP with PDO to connect to a MySQL database.
